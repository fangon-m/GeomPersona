    <h1>Discover the 16 Geom Personas</h1>

   <div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-01.png" alt="The Orb">
  <h2>The Orb</h2>
  <p>They’re the person who makes you feel safe without saying much. People naturally open up to them because they’re warm, steady, and genuinely care. Even in chaos, they stay calm and make others feel understood.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-02.png" alt="The Pillar">
  <h2>The Pillar</h2>
  <p>You can always count on them. They don’t like drama, they just do what needs to be done. Quiet but dependable, they’re usually the one holding everything together in the background.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-03.png" alt="The Apex">
  <h2>The Apex</h2>
  <p>They take the lead and get things done. Driven and organized, they hate wasting time and always aim high. Some might find them intense, but they just have high standards — for themselves and everyone else.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-04.png" alt="The Fractal">
  <h2>The Fractal</h2>
  <p>They see connections others don’t. Curious and open-minded, they’re always exploring new ideas or asking big “what if” questions. Talking to them often feels like a deep late-night conversation.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-05.png" alt="The Arc">
  <h2>The Arc</h2>
  <p>They’re thoughtful and a little mysterious. They don’t talk a lot, but when they do, it’s meaningful. They’re always learning, growing, and changing — even if no one notices right away.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-06.png" alt="The Mirror">
  <h2>The Mirror</h2>
  <p>They understand people deeply, often before anyone says a word. You feel seen when you’re around them. They’re quiet, observant, and always seem to “just get it.”</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-07.png" alt="The Spark">
  <h2>The Spark</h2>
  <p>They bring energy wherever they go. Quick to jump into new things, they love excitement and trying something new. You’ll never be bored when they’re around — they light things up fast.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-08.png" alt="The Hive">
  <h2>The Hive</h2>
  <p>They care a lot about people. They’re always checking in, organizing, making sure everyone’s okay. They make things feel like home, wherever they are.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-10.png" alt="The Drift">
  <h2>The Drift</h2>
  <p>There's a lot going on under the surface. Subtle joy, thoughtful, and kind. They may seem distant, but they care deeply and feel everything more than they show.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-09.png" alt="The Shift">
  <h2>The Shift</h2>
  <p>They adapt fast and think ahead. Always planning the next move, they don’t get stuck in one way of doing things. Change doesn’t scare them — they make it happen.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-11.png" alt="The Prism">
  <h2>The Prism</h2>
  <p>They’re full of ideas and always talking about something new. Funny, sharp, and unpredictable, you never really know what they’ll say next — but it’s always interesting.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-12.png" alt="The Hollow">
  <h2>The Hollow</h2>
  <p>They’re quiet, but you can feel a lot around them. They don’t need to explain much — their presence speaks for itself. Deep, emotional, and often in their own world, they make you think without trying.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-13.png" alt="The Lock">
  <h2>The Lock</h2>
  <p>They keep things close and protect what matters. Trust takes time with them, but once you have it, they’re loyal for life. They don’t overshare — they keep things simple and honest.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-14.png" alt="The Stack">
  <h2>The Stack</h2>
  <p>They’re problem-solvers. Quiet, logical, and hands-on — they just figure stuff out. They don’t need a plan; they just fix what’s broken and move on.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-15.png" alt="The Tower">
  <h2>The Tower</h2>
  <p>They think ahead and keep their emotions in check. Always planning, always focused, they’re not easy to read, but they’re always two steps ahead. They prefer structure and like knowing the “why” behind things.</p>
</div>

<div class="geom-persona"><img class="persona-img" src="img/solo-persona-16.png" alt="The Beacon">
  <h2>The Beacon</h2>
  <p>They light up the room. Fun, spontaneous, and full of life — people feel drawn to them. They don’t have to try to stand out — they just do.</p>
